      I Love automating tasks, especially if your doing it over and over again.
      Here's One notable proceses that I've done , one on my task is giving
      license to users whenever they want to login on SAP B1 Instead I created a
      portal that lets the request license and will be manage by SAP B1(Add-on
      module)
